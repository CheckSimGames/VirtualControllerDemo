# Virtual Controller Demo

This project is a simple example of moving a player around the screen in a SpriteKit using `GCVirtualController`, an Apple class in the Game Controller framework to create virtual game controllers on an iOS touch screen. Use the virtual joystick on the left side of the screen to move the sprite.

## System Requirements

iOS 15+

## Interesting Files

The `Player.swift` file has the code for working with the virtual controller. Look at the `connectVirtualController` function.
